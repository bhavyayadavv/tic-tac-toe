# Tic-Tac-Toe 

So yeah, this is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game I made for fun using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. It was mostly me trying to figure out how to make a grid, get Xs and Os to show up, and get the game to actually work. Spoiler: it does!

## Play it here

Check it out: [https://yourusername.github.io/tic-tac-toe](https://yourusername.github.io/tic-tac-toe)

## What it does

- Classic Tic-Tac-Toe with a 3x3 board
- Two players can take turns putting Xs and Os
- Detects when someone wins or if it’s a tie
- You can restart and play again

## What I learned

- How to make the board and handle clicks
- Keeping track of whose turn it is
- Figuring out who won (or if it’s a draw)
- How to put my project online with GitHub Pages

## What I want to add someday

- Maybe a scoreboard to keep track of wins
- An AI opponent (because playing with myself gets boring)
- Some cool animations or sounds
- Make it look nicer on phones

### Bottom line : Just a fun little project to practice coding and make something playable. Nothing fancy, but hey, it works!
